This Raycast extension is based on https://www.raycast.com/MrModest/reverso-context by [MrModest](https://www.raycast.com/MrModest).
I forked the original due to https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/17164.  

- This is an **early version** and is not yet available in the Raycast Store.
- You may have to change the [executablePath](https://github.com/adielBm/raycast-extension-reverso-context/blob/59e7920817dc98f5d6b4db73f3c6a61072761007/src/reversoApi.tsx#L27).
- To perform a search, end your query with a period (`.`).  
- The extension uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for web scraping.
